		<div id="Quote"><p>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then, is not an act, but a habit. | Aristotle</p></div>
		<div><p>Excellence is my habit, and I am writing to you in regards to becoming a web developer at your organization. I am confident in my programming skills and abilities, and know that I can prove to be a valuable asset to your company.</p></div>
		<div><p>My formal education background consists of two bachelorâ€™s degrees, one in Health Sciences Pre P.A. and second in Psychology from Cleveland State University. I am completely fluent and proficient in English and Urdu, I have taken over 6 years of tested Spanish throughout high school and college. In addition, within a span of two months since my employment at COMS, I have taught myself Html & Css, Sass, JavaScript, AngularJS, jQuery, SQL, Command Line, and Git Bash. I am also familiar with GitHub, Bootstrap, Jekyll, and Amazon Web Services. I have developed my own website www.OneSixtyOne.org to showcase my comprehensive knowledge and skills. My codes for the website can be viewed at: https://github.com/yasarabbasshah/yasarabbasshah.github.io. After holding multiple positions under IT, I've come to realize that my true passion and calling is to become a full stack developer.</p></div>
		<div><p>Being bilingual and multicultural allows me to process information differently. I easily adapt to situations with constant variances. I think outside the box and internalize new information quickly, which provides me a significant edge over my competitors when it comes to creative thinking and problem solving. I work well independently, but I firmly believe in the power of teamwork.</p></div>
		<div><p>These skills enable me to create innovative ways of further enhancing efficiency and goal achievement, while also increasing overall productivity and client satisfaction. Through my professional experiences I have been prepared to think critically, utilizing deductive and logical reasoning. The time spent in my previous roles has enabled me to recognize how exciting, challenging, and intellectually demanding a career in development can be.</p></div>
		<div><p>I am a highly motivated self-starter who is exceptionally reliable, dependable, and trustworthy. I am punctual and I excel at meeting deadlines regardless of difficulty, while working with a team or independently. I will work diligently day and night to actualize my goals. With all of my attributes, characteristics, knowledge, skills, and traits in mind, I am able to confidently say that I would be an excellent addition to your organization as a developer.
