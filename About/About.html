	<p class="PTxt">Hello, my name is Yasar Shah. I was born in Pakistan and moved to the United States when I was 11 years old. I went to Lakewood High School and graduated at the age of 16. I then worked odd jobs to put myself through college. I went to Cleveland State University where I earned two bachelor degrees:</p>		
		
	<div id="FirstDeg">
		<div><p class="ITdiv hvr-float-shadow">Bachelor Degree in Psychology. Graduated Cum Laude.</p></div>
		<div><p class="ITdiv hvr-float-shadow">Cleveland State University, Cleveland Ohio.</p></div>
		<div><p class="ITdiv hvr-float-shadow">Spring 2013.</p></div>
	</div>

	<div id="SecondDeg">
		<div><p class="ITdiv hvr-float-shadow">Bachelor Degree in Health Sciences Pre-P.A. Graduated Cum Laude.</p></div>
		<div><p class="ITdiv hvr-float-shadow">Cleveland State University, Cleveland, Ohio.</p></div>
		<div><p class="ITdiv hvr-float-shadow">Summer 2010</p></div>		
	</div>
	
	<p class="PTxt">After which I worked at The Cleveland Clinic for 1 year as Patient Finance Representative. Under that role I had to work within over 12 different hospital softwares simultaneously and perform various tasks. This was my first exposure to not just operating but also understanding software and its utilization as a powerful efficient tool to expedite storing and processing of information.</p>
	
	<p class="PTxt">I was then recruited by COMS Interactive where I worked for the next 2 years as a System Administrator and Quality Assurance Specialist. It was here that I fell in love with programing and developing. I found out just how challenging and rewarding it is to create a software so powerful that it can help millions of people and change the EMR field as we know it. I fell in love with the fact that software development is never stagnant and is an ever growing field. New development softwares are being continuously generated, making the learning and application potential infinite.</p>
	
	<p class="PTxt">Inspired by the belief my team, colleagues, friends, and family had in my potential, I ventured to become a developer by teaching myself Html, Css, Sass, JavaScript, AngularJS, jQuery, SQL, Command Line, and Git. Powerful tools which are necessary to develop world class websites.</p>
	
	<p class="PTxt">My goal is to never stop learning. I want to continue to constantly learn new softwares, and apply myself and my potential to its limits to become the best developer I can be.</p>
	
	<p class="PTxt">The rest is history.</p>
