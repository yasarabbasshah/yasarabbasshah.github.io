<div id="AboutSelf">
	<p>A little about myself.</p>
</div>




<div id="BoxOne">	
	
	<p class="PTxt">My name is Yasar, and I came to the United States when I was just 11 years old because of my parent’s innumerable monumental sacrifices to give my siblings and me the most optimal chance at success. Although I experienced this success in my youth, by graduating high school with honors and attending a nationally renowned university with a nearly full scholarship at the age of 16, I am truly humbled by the adversities and failures that I have faced and overcome since then. I am not ashamed to admit that I was suspended from said University due to my naïveté from youth and inexperience with the western culture, or that I have been homeless, or gone through tragic loss of my father that left my mother severely depressed, leaving me to tend to her and my younger siblings. Because facing each of these hardships resulted in my triumph. After my suspension from University, I worked harder than ever before by working three jobs and going to school full time, and I graduated with two bachelor’s degrees, both with Cum Laude honors within three years while also making the Dean's List each semester. I have lived in beautiful residences, and I have successfully provided for, and tended to, my family and their needs. I have worked for world-renowned companies, and continuously excelled in each of my endeavors. I overcame because I remained humble and true to my family, my friends, my colleagues, and myself and by making excellence my habit. I hope to bring this excellence to your organization.</p>		
		
	
	<p class="PTxt">My professional career started at the age of 16 when I started working odd jobs and as a gas station clerk until the age of 24 in 2012. That year I was hired as a shipping and receiving clerk at CO-AX Technology, Inc where I worked for a year. I was then hired as a Patient Financial Services Representative in Revenue Cycle Management at the Cleveland Clinic in 2013 where I also worked for a year. From here I was recruited as a Software Quality Assurance Analyst by COMS Interactive, LLC due to my reputation as an intelligent, hardworking, and dedicated individual. I worked at COMS for over 2 years and was promoted to System Administrator. Unfortunately, I was part of a massive companywide layoff in 2016 and became unemployed. However, I didn't stop my habit of excellence, and within just a few months taught myself front-end development, created and hosted my own website. I was then recruited by Beacon Hill Technologies for AmTrust Financial North America as a Software Quality Assurance Analyst for a 3-month contract to hire position in November of 2016. At AmTrust I performed so well that not only was I hired fulltime, but I was also promoted to Business Systems Analyst within three months. I worked for AmTrust for over a year until I was laid off in 2018.</p>
	
	<p class="PTxt">As you can see, excellence is my habit, and I have continuously struggled and improved dramatically in a short period of time. I acknowledge the limitless amount of knowledge, wisdom, and experience I have yet to gain. However, I am empowered and impassioned by a tremendous sense of duty to my loved ones and those who believe in me. I believe I can honor them by struggling, learning, and applying myself fully until I know that I have reached the peak of my potential and left a positive impact on this world. I am confident that I would be an excellent addition to your organization because of my eagerness to learn new information, grow personally, and excel professionally within your enterprise. I sincerely thank you for taking the time to get to know me.</p>
